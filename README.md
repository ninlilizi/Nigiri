### A dynamic, sparse voxel octree based global illumination system for Unity.

# Features.
* 2D & Single Pass Stereo Rendering
* Runs on Unity version 2018.4 ONLY (Will update, time permitting.)
* Depth buffer based voxelisation is less GPU intensive than other methods.
* Supports adding GI to 3rd party plugins that otherwise don't expose geometary to Unity.
* Multi-threaded to minimise use of the main thread.
* Asynchronous GPU reads throughout.
* Sparse octree based data storage and tracing.
* Sparse octree voxelizer is desiged as a [plugable module](https://github.com/ninlilizi/Nigiri/wiki/Module:-SVO-Voxelizer) to allow pain free custom integrations

# Compatibility
* The standard render pipeline is supported, only.
* Compatible with Windows and DirectX, only.  

Full policy on update and compatibility support is supplied on [the Wiki](https://github.com/ninlilizi/Nigiri/wiki)

## Community
If you need some help, feel free to ask any questions in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/QQspUgm).   
A Unity Forum thread will also be available at a later time.

## Licence
All code contributions and inclusions are to the best of my knowledge, MIT.

Nigiri as a whole, is also provided under standard MIT licence terms. With a simple request, that as I am a disabled person, struggling to attain suitable employment due to my health issues making a 9-5 commitment unviable. That if you profit from this work, donations are appreciated, but offers of actual paid work would make so much difference to my life. I'm dying of exposure out here!</br>
